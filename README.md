# Conway's Game of Life

This is my take on Conway’s Game of Life, built with WebGPU and React/Vite. I originally followed Google’s WebGPU course, where they make this game to teach WebGPU. After learning the basics, I added my own touches and improvements!

## Features

-  **Fast WebGPU rendering**  
-  **Smooth & responsive React UI**  
-  **Customizable** – tweak grid size, speed, and gliders  
-  **Random pattern generation** – including gliders!
